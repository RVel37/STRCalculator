# PCR Identity Calculator: helper scripts

This repository consists of a few scripts that were used while developing the PCR Identity Calculator for Exeter Genomics Laboratory.
The calculator (not included here) is formatted as an Excel spreadsheet and is used to calculate match probabilities for identity PCR testing.
Scripts were used to preprocess and reformat the data to suit our needs, and to generate Excel formulae programmatically.
